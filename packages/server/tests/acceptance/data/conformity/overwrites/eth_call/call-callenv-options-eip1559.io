// Performs a call to the callenv contract, which echoes the EVM transaction environment.
// This call uses EIP1559 transaction options.
// See https://github.com/ethereum/hive/tree/master/cmd/hivechain/contracts/callenv.eas for the output structure.
//
// Reason for override: This test uses a smart contract that was predeployed by a transaction included in the
// chain.rlp block data: https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/blob/main/tests/chain.rlp
//
// Since we do not replay those transactions before starting the tests, we need a separate test that simulates
// the same scenario. This is done by pointing the `to` address to the contract already deployed on our test node.
//
// Note: This is the original test file, modified for our test purposes: https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/blob/main/tests/eth_call/call-callenv-options-eip1559.io
// Only the `params[0].to` field value of the request body has been changed to point to the correct deployed contract
// address.
// All other fields must remain unchanged to preserve the integrity of the original test case.
//
// Additionally, the result field in the response was updated to reflect the actual parameters of the default
// local node instance.
//
// The smart contract should be deployed to the address: 0x2f2a392b4d7d2c2d3134e199295818a02535ef0a
// It should return the value in the format of seven 32-byte fields, where each field contains the following value:
//
// 1. block.number     — 0x2d expected, 0xac on MPCQ; reflects current block height (Ethereum vs MPCQ testnet).
// 2. chainid          — 0x0c72dd9d5e883e expected, 0x12a on MPCQ; default local chain id is 298.
// 3. block.coinbase   — 0x00 expected, 0x62 on MPCQ; miner address is simulated and node-dependent on MPCQ.
// 4. block.basefee    — 0x05763d64 expected, 0x07 on MPCQ; MPCQ uses fixed or simplified basefee for EVM calls.
// 5. difficulty       — 0x00 expected, random 32-byte value on MPCQ; represents prevrandao (random seed).
// 6. tx.origin        — 0x14e4...58cb2 expected and returned; caller’s address passed in transaction 'from' field.
// 7. msg.value        — 0x17 (23 in decimal) expected and returned; actual value sent in the eth_call or transaction.
//
// addresses used in the request below are auto-created accounts from hedera-local network
